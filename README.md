Yet Another OSCP Repository

Yet another repository for OSCP commands, tricks, tips, attack chains and scripts. All used in some way during my OSCP journey. Will be updated as I go along each lab and PG machine.

Please note nearly everything in this repo was taken from another source, or modified by me in a particular way to make things easier. This is more of a compilation of data than an in-depth review or "how-to". See the Acknowledgements for a few sources that helped spawn this.

These won't look neat or fancy but they get the job done and will hopefully help you!

#Acknowledgements
Swissky and everyone who worked on the "PayloadAllTheThings" repo, with the Windows and AD attack/privesc cheat sheets being attached to the "Windows_Privesc" and "AD" sheets

adsecurity.org for mimikatz/AD tips

The great people in the Offensive Security discord who have helped me troubleshoot all these fun things!
