See a file that could give you root but can't edit it? Is it a symlink? If so:
ln -sfn [file_name]
it's yours now :D

Stuck in a restricted shell? https://www.exploit-db.com/docs/english/44592-linux-restricted-shell-bypass-guide.pdf

can we make an ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file?
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
copy the file contents of the new id_rsa.pub
curl,nano, or echo the contents into /home/[user]/.ssh/authorized_keys
Test you can connect using the private key!

If all else fails: linpeas!
